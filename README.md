## Our Goal

The objective of this Project is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We'll look at how to carry out time-consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.


## Info

We’re going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end of the module, we will be able to find out the live weather data in the device's current location as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
